# Flight_Delay_Predictor

This project is to analyize flight delay data from the Bureay of Transportation Statistics (BTS) and create models to predict whether a flight is likely to be delayed. This is split into three part: data cleaning, data analysis, and modeling. 

\textbf{Data Cleaning}

From the data, we'll first clean out any non-numeric or NaN columns that wouldn't affect the flight data. 


\textbf{Data Analysis}

After the data has been cleaning, we'll find if there are any correlations among the numberic data and flight delays

\textbf{Modeling}

Using a Logistic Regression Model, we'll create a model that will predict flight delays. From their accuracy scores, classification, report, and confusion matrices, we can check the accuracy of the model.
